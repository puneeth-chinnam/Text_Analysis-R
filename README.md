## Data Wrangling and Text Analysis

Performed data wrangling and text analysis on Elon Musk's tweets from 2012-2021:

1. Computed word frequencies for each year. Excluded stop words.

2. Displayed top 10 words (for each year) by highest word frequency value.

3. Plotted histogram of word frequencies for each year.

4. Used Zipfâ€™s law and plotted log-log plots of word frequencies vs rank for each year. 

5. Created bigram network graphs for each year.

## Methodology

- Imported Elon Musk's tweet dataset as CSV. 

- Performed data cleaning - removed emojis, punctuation, etc.

- Tokenized tweets into words.

- Removed stop words using NLTK library. 

- Calculated frequency of each word per year.

- Filtered and displayed top 10 frequent words per year.

- Visualized word frequencies using histograms.

- Applied Zipf's law to rank words by frequency and plotted log-log graphs.

- Created bigram networks with word associations for each year.

## Analysis and Insights

- Observed Lexical richness and diversity of vocabulary over the years. 

- Identified topic trends and associations from frequent terms and bigrams.

- Validated Zipf's law on word frequency distribution.

- Compared language usage and evolution across the years.
